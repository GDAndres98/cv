## üéà Interests

**Problem Solving Algorithms**<br>
I have a background in competitive programming contests and interest on algorithmic and mathematical solutions from the simpliest to the most complicated problem
<br>

**Software Development**<br>
One of the reasons why I chose this career was to know how the tools that we use every day on computers work. Now this has been transformed into an interest in implementing them
